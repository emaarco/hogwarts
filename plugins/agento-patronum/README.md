## 🛡️ What it protects you from

Claude Code is powerful. That power needs boundaries.
When Claude can read your `.env`, your SSH keys, your AWS credentials — it will.
Not maliciously. Just helpfully. agento-patronum draws the line.

It enforces file protection via **PreToolUse hooks** — the only layer Claude Code can't silently bypass.
Settings.json deny rules are confirmed buggy. Hooks are reliable.

## ⚡ Install in two commands

```bash
# Add marketplace (once per machine)
/plugin marketplace add emaarco/hogwarts

# Install plugin (user scope — protects all projects)
/plugin install agento-patronum@emaarco
```

Restart Claude Code once. Done. Run `/patronum-verify` to confirm.

## 📋 Prerequisites

agento-patronum requires **jq** for JSON processing. Install it:

```bash
# macOS
brew install jq

# Linux (Debian/Ubuntu)
apt install jq

# Linux (RHEL/CentOS)
yum install jq

# WSL / Windows
apt install jq
```

The setup script will fail with a clear error if jq is missing. No other dependencies.

## 🧰 Available skills

agento-patronum is built with [skills](https://agentskills.io) — the open specification for agent capabilities. Invoke them as slash commands in Claude Code:

| Skill | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `/patronum-add` | Add a pattern to the protection list |
| `/patronum-remove` | Remove a pattern |
| `/patronum-list` | Show all protected patterns |
| `/patronum-suggest` | Get stack-specific protection suggestions |
| `/patronum-verify` | Run self-test to verify enforcement |

## 🔒 What's protected by default

Out of the box, agento-patronum blocks access to:

| Category | Patterns |
|----------|----------|
| Environment files | `**/.env`, `**/.env.*` |
| Private keys | `**/*.pem`, `**/*.key` |
| SSH | `~/.ssh/*` |
| AWS | `~/.aws/credentials`, `~/.aws/config` |
| Docker | `~/.docker/config.json` |
| Kubernetes | `~/.kube/config` |
| Package tokens | `~/.npmrc`, `~/.pypirc` |
| Shell commands | `printenv`, `env`, `set` |

Need more? Run `/patronum-suggest` — it analyzes your stack and recommends what to add.

## ⚙️ How it works

agento-patronum registers a `PreToolUse` hook that intercepts every `Read`, `Write`, `Edit`, and `Bash` tool call. It checks the file path or command against patterns in `~/.claude/patronum.json`. If a pattern matches, the tool call is blocked and logged.

No cloud, no binary, no Python. Pure bash + jq.

## 📖 Story behind the plugin

Claude Code's `permissions.deny` rules in `settings.json` should prevent access to sensitive files.
They don't — deny rules are frequently ignored due to confirmed bugs.

agento-patronum was built because the only reliable way to protect files is through PreToolUse hooks.
The plugin makes this protection accessible via two install commands and manageable via slash commands.
